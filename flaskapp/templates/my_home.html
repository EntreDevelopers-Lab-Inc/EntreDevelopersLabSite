                  <p class="text-dark">Website building do-it-yourself companies charge $10-$20 a month for hosting
                    even the simplest of websites. Moreover, you become locked into a platform and never own the source
                    code to your site, making all you efforts in designing it useless when trying to add custom features
                    with development teams. With us, you can expect server costs of $5 per month, saving you hundreds over
                    only a few years.

                    trend is only set to increase in the near future. We assure our customers that their sites will be mobile-ready
                    upon release. This way, you can rest easy knowing that your customers will have access to your site, no matter
