          To understand Web3, you must first understand Web1 and Web2. Originally (Web1), internet users could only access information, much like a newspaper. During this period, people could not interact in many of the ways that we find common today. After the adoption of Web2, users gained the ability to participate in the building of the internet by being able to upload information. Thus, we reached the age of social media (posting on Twitter, Facebook, etc.). In the Web2 paradigm, all information must be stored somewhere. Thus, corporations like Alphabet and Twitter stored user information and became the data giants that they are today.

          So where are we today? The innovation of the blockchain allows people to store their own data and use it however they wish. Consider a simple scenario: someone is hosting a party and would like to know what music their guests like. In the Web2 world, the host must asks each of the invitees to manually submit a form with their favorite songs/artists. Alternatively, the user could ask Spotify to create a tool for dozens of people to mix musiv preferences together. Either way, it is unlikely that the host will endure the headache of gathering music preferences. However, with Web3, each guest would own their listening history, making it portable to any scenario. Thus, the guests can grant the host access to their data, and the host can aggregate a playlist (e.g. the last 5 songs that each guest has listened to before the party). This is what Web3 is all about! Users should have access to their own data. This way, even someone with minimal knowledge of data manipulation can leverage this information in innovative ways.

          Currently, the world is rushing to integrate Web3 technology (NFT tickets, redeemable tokens, etc.). Understanding the proper technology for your use case can be difficult, and finding a qualified team to implement it can be even harder. With several protocols under our belts, we hope to be the software development partner that helps your business step forward. Web3 is here to stay, and we are grateful for the opportunity to be at the cutting edge.

              <p class="margin-top-15">
                We believe in connecting people. Thus, we have developed NFT protocols pushing the limits of interaction, creating real, on-chain utility. Going forward, we continue to believe in the power of non-fungible tokens and their ability to represent unique nodes in a network. With the ability to create unique nodes on the blockchain, we can help businesses create tickets, coupons, and digital property for their customers. Adoption of NFT technology has just begun, and we believe that there is a vast universe of unexplored uses for the powerful innovation.

                Decentralized Finance (DeFi) allows users and businesses to quickly gain access to powerful financial tools. We have developed multiple DeFi protocols, ranging from decentralized bond issuances to digital property (NFT) exchanges. Going forward, we hope to continue empowering businesses by building tools to help them raise capital, interact with their users, and facilitate modern commerce. Thus, we look forward to building the next blocks of the financial system.
